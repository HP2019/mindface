# MindFace: 
Face recognition and detection occupy an important position in the face field. MindFace is an open source toolkit based on MindSpore, containing the most advanced face recognition and detection models, such as ArcFace, RetinaFace and other models, mainly for face recognition and detection and other common application scenarios.

For all main contributors, please check [contributing](#contributing).


## Introduction
---
MindFace mainly has the following features.
- Unified Application Programming Interface

    MindFace provides a unified application programming interface for face recognition and detection by decoupling the models, so that the model can be called directly using the mindface APIs, which greatly improves the ease of building algorithms for users

- Strong extensibility

    MindFace currently supports face recognition and detection, based on the unified APIs. MindFace is highly scalable, it can support lots of backbones, datasets, and loss functions. What's More, MindFace also supports many platforms, including CPU/GPU/Ascend.

#### Detection
---
For Face detection, We choose resnet50 and mobilenet0.25 as the backbone, retinaface as the model architecture to achieve efficient performance of face detection. Detailed results are shown in the table below. 

##### WiderFace Val Performance in multiscale When using ResNet50 or mobileNet025 as backbone.
